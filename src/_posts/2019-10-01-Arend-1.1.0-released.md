title:  "Arend 1.1.0 released"
---

Arend now has proof irrelevant universe of proposition and the plugin can run the typechecker automatically in background.

Language updates:
* [\Prop](/about/arend-features#the-universe-of-propositions) is now proof irrelevant.
  In particular, this means that we do not need {%ard%} Path.inProp {%endard%} anymore.
* [Right operator sections](/documentation/language-reference/definitions#infix-operators).
* New function and \case forms: [\sfunc](/documentation/language-reference/definitions/functions#sfunc) and [\scase](/documentation/language-reference/expressions/case#scase).
  It is necessary to use these forms for [squashed data types](/documentation/language-reference/definitions/level#squashed-data-types)
* Improved error messages.

Plugin updates:
* Implemented [background typechecking](/about/intellij-features#typechecking).
* Implemented [pattern generator](/about/intellij-features#pattern-generator) for missing clauses and case analysis.
  Note that case analysis currently does not work for {%ard%} \case {%endard%} expressions.
* Improved [class hierarchy](/about/intellij-features#class-hierarchy).
* Added gutter icons for subclasses.
* Improved module configuration dialog.
* Fixed completion and inline renaming for infix and postfix notation.
