title: "Part I: Dependent Types"
toc: false
---

This part is an introduction to the actual practices of working with dependent types in Arend. It contains
example-based Arend-specific exposition of efficient ways of working with propositions and proofs, inductive types, classes and records,
type universes, etc. We assume that the reader is familiar with related theoretical concepts, most importantly with Martin-Lof type theory
and Curry-Howard correspondence.
