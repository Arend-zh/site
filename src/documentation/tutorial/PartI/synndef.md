title: Basics
nav: syn-n-def
---

In this module we explain the syntax and some key constructs of the Arend language, required to get started with
writing definitions, propositions and proofs.

Arend has the following kinds of definitions: functions, data definitions, classes and records. As of now, we only consider
functions and data definitions, exposition of classes and records is deferred to [Records and Classes](records). 

Some of the most basic definitions are built into the language and contained in the module Prelude. For example, Prelude
contains
types {%ard%}Nat{%endard%} and {%ard%}Int{%endard%} of natural and integer numbers respectively and the equality
type {%ard%}={%endard%}.   

# Lexical structure

All keywords in Arend start with backslash {%ard%}\\ {%endard%}. For example, function and data definitions start with
keywords {%ard%}\func{%endard%} and {%ard%}\data{%endard%} respectively.

Numerals, if they occur in terms, are always interpreted as elements of types {%ard%}Nat{%endard%} or {%ard%}Int{%endard%}:
non-negative numerals are of type {%ard%}Nat{%endard%}, negative numerals are of type {%ard%}Int{%endard%}.

Arend allows considerable amount of freedom in the choice of identifiers. With a few exceptions, names of definitions, variables
etc may contain upper or lower case letters, digits and characters from the list `~!@#$%^&*-+=<>?/|[]:_`.

# Functions

Function definitions start with the keyword {%ard%}\func{%endard%}. Functions in Arend are mathematical functions.
In particular, this means that they are _pure_ and do not interact with the environment via input-output.

The simplest definition of a function must contain the name of a function
and its body. For example, the zero constant function `f` without parameters can be defined as follows: 

{% arend %}
\func f => 0 -- constant function
{- Haskell:
   f = 0
-}
{% endarend %}

The body of {%ard%}f{%endard%} is just the numeral {%ard%}0{%endard%} of type {%ard%}Nat{%endard%}. The result type 
{%ard%}Nat{%endard%} of {%ard%}f{%endard%} in this case is inferred by the typechecker, but it can also be specified explicitly:

{% arend %}
\func f : Nat => 0 -- constant with explicit type
{- Haskell:
   f :: Nat
   f = 0
-}
{% endarend %}  

In case a function has parameters, they can be specified together with their types just after the name of the
function as shown below:

{% arend %}
\func id (x : Nat) => x -- identity function on natural numbers
\func id' (x : Nat) : Nat => x  -- the same, but with explicit result type
{- Haskell:
   id :: Nat -> Nat
   id x = x
-}
\func foo (x _ : Nat) (_ : Int) => x -- simply returning the first argument
{- Haskell:
   foo :: Nat -> Nat -> Int -> Nat
   foo x y z = x
-}
{% endarend %}

As demonstrated in the definition of {%ard%}foo{%endard%}, if a parameter is not used, you can omit the specification
of its name by using the symbol `_`. Also, if several consecutive parameters have the same type, they can be merged:
{%ard%}(x _ : Nat){%endard%} is equivalent to {%ard%}(x : Nat) (_ : Nat){%endard%}.

Note that in contrast to Haskell, types of parameters should always be specified:

{% arend %}
\func id'' x => x -- this definition is not correct!
{- Haskell:
   id'' x = x
-}
{% endarend %}

Equivalently, parameters of a function can be moved from the signature to the body by means of lambda expressions:

{%arend%}
 -- types of parameters cannot be infered as before
\func foo' => \lam (x _ : Nat) (_ : Int) => x
-- but parameters can be omitted if the type is specified explicitly
\func foo'' : Nat -> Nat -> Int -> Nat => \lam x _ _ => x  
{- Haskell:
   foo'' :: Nat -> Nat -> Int -> Nat
   foo'' = \x y z -> x
-}
{%endarend%}

In the examples above we specified the bodies of functions by simply writing a term after the symbol {%ard%}=>{%endard%}.
Of course, there are more sophisticated ways to define the body of a function, for example, in case the function is recursive.
Namely, functions can also be defined by _pattern matching_, we will consider such functions [below](#data-definitions). 

# Infix operators

<!-- TODO: illustrate the concepts by giving an example of an expression and explaining how it is parsed -->

By default all binary operators, just as normal functions, are prefix. In order to define an infix operator one should specify before the name
of the operator one of the keywords 
{%ard%}\infix{%endard%}, {%ard%}\infixl{%endard%} or {%ard%}\infixr{%endard%} together with a positive integer for priority:

{%arend%}
\func \infixl 6 $$ (x y : Nat) => x
\func test => 3 $$ 7 -- test returns 3
{- Haskell:
   infixl 6 $$
   ($$) x y = x
   test = 3 $$ 7
-}
{%endarend%}

Priority can be any positive integer between 1 and 9.

Any binary operator, even if it was not declared as infix, can be used in infix form by means of surrounding it with {%ard%}\` \`{%endard%}. 

{%arend%}
\func ff (x y : Nat) => x
\func ff_test => 0 `ff` 1
{- Haskell:
   ff x y = x
   ff_test = 3 `ff` 7
-}
{%endarend%}

Any infix operator can also be used in the prefix from:

{%arend%}
\func \infix 6 %% (x y : Nat) => x
\func %%-test => %% 3 7 -- no need to surround %% with ( )
{- Haskell:
   infix 5 %%
   (%%) x y = x
   pp_test = (%%) 3 7
-}
{%endarend%}

# Data definitions

Data definitions allow to define new _inductive_ and _higher-inductive_ types by specifying their ''generating'' elements,
called _constructors_. 

In the simplest case, when constructors do not have parameters, an inductive type is just a finite set formed by its constructors.
For example, the empty type {%ard%}Empty{%endard%}, the one-element unit type {%ard%}Unit{%endard%} and the two-element type 
{%ard%}Bool{%endard%} of boolean values with two constructors {%ard%}true{%endard%} and {%ard%}false{%endard%} can be defined as follows: 

{%arend%}
\data Empty
{- Haskell:
   data Empty
-}

\data Unit | unit
{- Haskell:
   data Unit = Unit
-}

\data Bool | false | true
{- Haskell:
   data Bool = False | True
-}
{%endarend%}

Defining a function on {%ard%}Bool{%endard%} naturally corresponds to specifying its values on {%ard%}true{%endard%}
and {%ard%}false{%endard%} via the mechanism called _pattern matching_. For example, functions {%ard%}not{%endard%} and
{%ard%}if{%endard%} can be defined as follows:

{%arend%}
\func not (x : Bool) : Bool \with -- keyword \with can be omitted
  | true => false
  | false => true
{- Haskell:
   not :: Bool -> Bool
   not True = False
   not False = True
-}

\func if (x : Bool) (t e : Nat) : Nat \elim x
  | true => t
  | false => e
{- Haskell:
   if :: Bool -> Nat -> Nat -> Nat
   if True t e = t
   if False t e = e
-}

{%endarend%}

Typically, inductive types have constructors with parameters. In contrast to parameters of functions, it is allowed 
to write {%ard%}cons T{%endard%} instead of {%ard%}cons (_ : T){%endard%}.
 
Types of these parameters may refer to the inductive type
itself, for example, as we will shortly see in case of the type of natural numbers. However, there is an important restriction:
all occurrences of an inductive type in types of parameters of constructors must be _strictly positive_. This means that 
the inductive type cannot occur to the left of ->. If such definitions were allowed, it would have been possible to
define the type of ''all untyped lambda terms'' {%ard%}K{%endard%}. In particular, non-terminating terms
could have been coded as elements of {%ard%}K{%endard%}.

{%arend%}
\data K | k (K -> K)
\func I => k (\lam x => x)
\func Kc => k (\lam x => k (\lam _ => x))
\func app (f a : K) : K \elim f
  | k f' => f' a
\func omega => k (\lam x => app x x)
{%endarend%}

Let us turn to another example: the type of natural numbers. Definitions of the type {%ard%}Nat{%endard%}
and of operations {%ard%}+{%endard%}, {%ard%}*{%endard%} from Prelude can be reproduced as follows:

{%arend%}
\data Nat | zero | suc Nat

-- the following functions are equivalent
\func three => suc (suc (suc zero))
\func three' => 3

-- there is no limit on the size of numbers
\func bigNumber => 1000000000000000000000000

\func \infixl 6 + (x y : Nat) : Nat \elim y
  | 0 => x
  | suc y => suc (x + y)
{- Haskell:
   (+) :: Nat -> Nat -> Nat
   x + Zero = x
   x + Suc y = Suc (x + y)
-}

-- If n is a variable, then n + 2 evaluates to suc (suc n),
-- but 2 + n does not as it is already in the normal form.
-- This behaviour depends on the definition of +, namely,
-- the argument chosen for pattern matching.

\func \infixl 7 * (x y : Nat) : Nat \elim y
  | 0 => 0
  | suc y => x * y + x
{- Haskell:
   (*) :: Nat -> Nat -> Nat
   x * Zero = 0
   x * Suc y = x * y + x
-}
{%endarend%}

This is not the only way to define a type of natural numbers. The definition above corresponds to unary representation
of natural numbers. The type of binary natural numbers can be defined as follows: 

{%arend%}
\data BinNat
    | zero'
    | sh+1 BinNat -- x*2+1
    | sh+2 BinNat -- x*2+2
{%endarend%}

Efficiency-wise this definition is obviously much better. However, it is much less convenient for proofs by
induction, than the definition of {%ard%}Nat{%endard%} above. And actually the type {%ard%}Nat{%endard%} from Prelude
is efficient as well, because actual implementations of arithmetic operations differ from those above and
efficiently hard coded in ad hoc way.

# Termination, div

Functions can be recursive, but they cannot refer to themselves in an arbitrary way. If the recursion were unrestricted,
every proposition could have been trivially proven: 
{%arend%}
\func theorem : 0 = 1 => theorem
{%endarend%}

Moreover, the typechecking procedure in dependently typed language needs to check termination. Consequently, the language
cannot be Turing complete, because typechecking becomes undecidable in this case. 
 
Intensional Martin-Lof type theory avoids this kind of issues by ensuring that all definable functions are total, that is
their evaluation terminates on every input.
It is thus typical for theorem provers, that have Martin-Lof type theory in the core of their type system, to require
all functions to terminate and all recursive functions to be defined by _structural recursion_. And this also
applies to Arend.

For example, consider the division function {%ard%}div{%endard%} for natural numbers. An obvious but not correct
definition may look like this:

{%arend%}
\func div (x y : Nat) : Nat => if (x < y) 0 (suc (div (x - y) y))
{%endarend%}

There are two problems with this definition. Firstly, evaluation of {%ard%}div x 0{%endard%} does not terminate.
Secondly, the recursion is not structural. Structural recursion requires arguments of recursive calls to be 
structurally simpler than the original argument.

A recursive function can often be turned into structurally recursive function by introducing additional parameter, which decreases 
with the increase of the level of recursive calls. Initial value of this parameter can be set to an upper bound to the
number of recursive steps: 
{%arend%}
\func div (x y : Nat) => div' x x y
  \where
    \func div' (s x y : Nat) : Nat \elim s
        | 0 => 0
        | suc s => if (x < y) 0 (suc (div' s (x - y) y))
{%endarend%}

# Polymorphism

Some definitions are polymorphic, that is they can be naturally parameterised by a type. Such definitions
can be stated with the use of the type {%ard%}\Type{%endard%} of all types. For example, the polymorphic identity
function can be stated as follows:

{%arend%}
\func id (A : \Type) (a : A) => a
{- Haskell:
   id :: a -> a
   id x = x
-}

-- the syntax A -> B is used for types of functions, 
--                         the codomain of which does not depend on the argument   
-- for example, (id Nat) has type Nat -> Nat
-- Pi-types generalize them, allowing codomain to depend on the argument
\func idType : \Pi (A : \Type) (a : A) -> A => id
{- Haskell:
   idType :: a -> a
   idType = id
-}
{%endarend%}

Note that {%ard%}\Type{%endard%} is not a genuine type: the famous Girard's paradox states that intensional Martin-Lof's
type theory is inconsistent with the type of all types. In reality, {%ard%}\Type{%endard%} is a syntactic sugar for
the cumulative hierarchy of universes of types {%ard%}\Type 0{%endard%} < ... <  {%ard%}\Type p{%endard%} < ...,
parameterized by the _predicative level_ {%ard%}p{%endard%}, where {%ard%}\Type p{%endard%} is roughly the type of all 
types that _do not_ refer in their definitions to universes with predicative level {%ard%}p{%endard%} and higher. Fortunately,
the user does not need to care about these levels, which are automatically inferred and hidden from the user, unless
he or she uses forbidden circularities, in which case typechecker will generate an error.    

# Implicit arguments

It is quite often the case that some arguments in a function application are completely determined by others. In 
such cases user may ask typechecker to infer these arguments by writing {%ard%}_{%endard%} in place of them. For 
example, an application of {%ard%}id{%endard%} function defined above may look as follows:  

{%arend%}
\func idTest => id _ 0
{%endarend%}

In this case the typechecker can infer {%ard%}Nat{%endard%} as the value of the first argument, because it must be
the type of the second argument, which is {%ard%}Nat{%endard%}. If the typechecker fails to infer an argument, it
generates an error.

If a parameter of a definition is expected to be always or most of the times determined by others, it can be specified
as _implicit_ by surrounding it in curly braces. In this case the corresponding arguments can be skipped altogether:
  
{%arend%}
\func id' {A : \Type} (a : A) => a

\func id'Test => id' 0
\func id'Test' => id' {Nat} 0 -- implicit arguments can be specifyed explicitly
{%endarend%}

<!-- TODO

-- В данном случае лучше n не делать неявным, так как тайпчекер не сможет его вывести из типа p, так как n встречается только внутри вызова функции.
-- Например, если мы вызовем example' pp, где pp : 8 = 3, то тайпчекер не может вывести, что n должно равняться 4.
\func example' {n : Nat} (p : n + n = 3) => 0

-- В данном случае n и m можно сделать неявнымы, так как они встречается только под \data (= определено через Path, который является \data) и конструктором (suc).
-- \data и конструкторы являются инъективными, поэтому тайпчекер всегда может вывести n и m в таких случаях.
-- Например, если мы вызовем example'' pp, где pp : 8 = 3, то тайпчекер понимает, что m должно равняться 3, а suc n должно равняться 8.
-- Так как 8 = suc 7 и suc инъективен, то он понимает, что n должно равняться 7.
\func example'' {n m : Nat} (p : suc n = m) => 0
\func example''Test (pp : 8 = 3) => example'' pp

-->

# List, append

By now we have discussed all the things necessary to properly define the polymorphic type of lists:

{%arend%}
\data List (A : \Type) | nil | cons A (List A)
{- Haskell:
   data List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)
-}

-- Constructors have implicit parameters for each of the parameters of datatype
\func emptyList => nil {Nat}

-- Operator 'append'
\func \infixl 6 ++ {A : \Type} (xs ys : List A) : List A \elim xs
  | nil => ys
  | cons x xs => cons x (xs ++ ys)
{- Haskell:
   (++) :: List a -> List A -> List a
   Nil ++ ys = ys
   cons x xs ++ ys = cons x (xs ++ ys)
-}

{%endarend%}

# Tuples and Sigma-types

Given two types {%ard%}A{%endard%} and {%ard%}B{%endard%}, one can construct the type {%ard%}\Sigma A B{%endard%}
of pairs {%ard%}(a, b){%endard%}, where {%ard%}a : A{%endard%} and {%ard%}b : B{%endard%}. The type {%ard%}\Sigma A B{%endard%}
is equivalent to the datatype defined as follows:

{%arend%}
\data Pair | pair A B
{%endarend%}

More generally, for any family of types {%ard%}A1{%endard%}, ..., {%ard%}An{%endard%} one can form the type 
{%ard%}\Sigma A1 ... An{%endard%} of tuples {%ard%}(a1, ..., an){%endard%}, where {%ard%}ai : Ai{%endard%}. Moreover, 
the tuples can be dependent in the sense that {%ard%}Ai{%endard%} can depend on {%ard%}a1{%endard%}, ..., {%ard%}a{i-1}{%endard%}.

A trivial example -- the type {%ard%}\Sigma{%endard%}, which is equivalemt to the one-element type {%ard%}Unit{%endard%}.

More interesting example -- the type {%ard%}\Sigma (n : Nat) (\Sigma (k : Nat) (n = k * k)){%endard%} of natural numbers {%ard%}n{%endard%}
that are full squares: its elements are pairs {%ard%}(n, p){%endard%}, where {%ard%}n{%endard%} is a natural number and 
{%ard%}p : \Sigma (k : Nat) (n = k * k){%endard%} is a proof that {%ard%}n{%endard%} is a square. 

If {%ard%}x{%endard%} is an element of type {%ard%}\Sigma A1 ... An{%endard%}, i-th component of {%ard%}x{%endard%}, where
i is a numeral, can be accessed by the projection operator {%ard%}x.i{%endard%}. Note that eta equivalence holds for 
Sigma-types: if {%ard%}x : \Sigma A1... An{%endard%}, then {%ard%}(x.1, ..., x.n){%endard%} is computationally equal
to {%ard%}x{%endard%}.  

# Examples of propositions and proofs

Here we will give several simple examples of propositions and proofs, using what we have discussed so far. 

In order to illustrate the correspondence between the empty type {%ard%}Empty{%endard%} and the logical False, we can prove
that False implies everything by constructing an element of any type from an element in {%ard%}Empty{%endard%}:

{%arend%}
\func absurd {A : \Type} (e : Empty) : A

\func absurd' {A : \Type} (e : Empty) : A \elim e
  | () -- absurd pattern
{%endarend%}

Now let's prove some statements about the two-element type {%ard%}Bool{%endard%} defined
earlier. Consider the function {%ard%}T{%endard%} that interprets {%ard%}true : Bool{%endard%} as the proposition
True (type {%ard%}Unit{%endard%}) and {%ard%}false : Bool{%endard%} as the proposition False (type {%ard%}Empty{%endard%}):

{%arend%}
\func T (b : Bool) : \Type
  | true => Unit
  | false => Empty
{%endarend%}

We formulate some properties of {%ard%}Bool{%endard%}, expressable in terms of equality predicate for {%ard%}Bool{%endard%}:

{%arend%}
\func \infix 4 == (x y : Bool) : Bool
  | true, true => true
  | false, false => true
  | _ , _ => false
{%endarend%}

For example, propositions {%ard%}x == x{%endard%} and {%ard%}T (not (not x) == x){%endard%} can be proven by case analysis: 

{%arend%}
\func not-isInvolution (x : Bool) : T (not (not x) == x)
  | true => unit -- if x is true, then T (not (not true) == true) evaluates to Unit
  | false => unit -- if x is false, then T (not (not false) == false) again evaluates to Unit

-- proof of reflexivity of == is analogous 
\func ==-refl (x : Bool) : T (x == x)
  | true => unit
  | false => unit
{%endarend%}

In both cases in both proofs we simply return {%ard%}unit{%endard%}. Note that we cannot return {%ard%}unit{%endard%} without case analysis since
both {%ard%}T (not (not x) == x){%endard%} and {%ard%}T (x == x){%endard%} do not evalute to {%ard%}Unit{%endard%}. The following code does not typecheck:

{%arend%}
\func not-isInvolution' (x : Bool) : T (not (not x) == x) => unit
{%endarend%}

It is not possible to prove false statements in this way:

{%arend%}
\func not-isIdempotent (x : Bool) : T (not (not x) == not x)
  | true => {?} -- goal expression, an element of Empty is expected
  | false => {?} -- goal expression, an element of Empty is expected

-- we can prove negation of not-isIdempoten
\func not-isIdempotent' (x : Bool) : T (not (not x) == not x) -> Empty
  | true => \lam x => x -- a proof of Empty -> Empty
  | false => \lam x => x -- again a proof of Empty -> Empty
{%endarend%}

Let us also prove something, involving quantification. For example, the statement 
"for every {%ard%}x : Bool{%endard%} there exists {%ard%}y : Bool{%endard%} such that x == y":
{%arend%}
-- Sigma-types are used to express existential quantification
\func lemma (x : Bool) : \Sigma (y : Bool) (T (x == y)) => (x, ==-refl x)
{%endarend%}

The following is a proof of rather awkward statement "if every {%ard%}x : Bool{%endard%} equals itself, then {%ard%}true : Bool{%endard%}
equals {%ard%}true : Bool{%endard%}":

{%arend%}
\func higherOrderFunc (f : \Pi (x : Bool) -> T (x == x)) : T (true == true) => f true
{%endarend%}

# Identity type

The way how we defined equality {%ard%}=={%endard%} for {%ard%}Bool{%endard%} above is not actually satisfactory. Its definition
is specific for {%ard%}Bool{%endard%}, we need to make analogous definitions for all other types and each time prove, say, that it is
equivalence relation. 

Instead, we define an identity type for all types at once. Its definition is located in Prelude (type {%ard%}Path{%endard%} and its
infix form {%ard%}={%endard%}). We will not get into details for now, all that we currently need is the proof of reflexivity {%ard%}idp : a = a{%endard%}, which is also defined in Prelude.

Now, all the equalities that we proved for {%ard%}=={%endard%} can similarly proved for {%ard%}={%endard%}. For example, 
the equality {%ard%}not (not x) = x{%endard%}:

{%arend%}
\func not-isInvolution'' (x : Bool) : not (not x) = x
  | true => idp
  | false => idp
{%endarend%}

And as before, we cannot prove false statements:

{%arend%}
\func not-isIdempotent'' (x : Bool) : not (not x) = not x
  | true => {?} -- goal expression, non-existing proof of true = false is expected
  | false => {?} -- goal expression, non-existing proof of false = true is expected
{%endarend%}

# Type synonyms

There is no need for type synonyms in dependently types language since we can simply define a function returning the type,
synonym of which is being defined:

{%arend%}
\func NatList => List Nat
{- Haskell:
   type NatList = List Nat
-}
{%endarend%}

# Namespaces and modules

Each definition can be accompanied by {%ard%}\where{%endard%} block in the end. In contrast to Haskell, {%ard%}\where{%endard%} block
is attached to the whole definition, not to a particular clause:

{%arend%}
\func f => g \where \func g => 0
{%endarend%}

Definitions in {%ard%}\where{%endard%} block in almost all respects behave just as normal definitions. The only difference is that
it has different namespace:

{%arend%}  
\func gTest => f.g
{%endarend%}

Alternatively, one can use {%ard%}\let{%endard%}, which is, however, limited and simpler than 'let' in Haskell. In Arend,
{%ard%}\let{%endard%} cannot contain recursive functions and each variable can only depend on previous variables: 

{%arend%}
\func letExample => \let
    | x => 1
    | y => x + x
    \in x + y * y
{%endarend%}

Definitions in Arend can be grouped in _modules_:

{%arend%}
\module M1 \where {
    \func f => 82
    \func g => 77
    \func h => 25
}

-- definitions f, g and h are unavailable in the current namespace
-- they should be accessed with the prefix M1.
\func moduleTest => (M1.f,M1.g,M1.h)
{%endarend%}

If a module is opened by the {%ard%}\open{%endard%} command, then its definitions can be accessed directly without the prefix:

{%arend%}
\module M2 \where {
   \open M1
   \func t => f
   \func t' => g
   \func t'' => h
}
{%endarend%}

It is possible to open just some particular definitions in a module:

{%arend%}
\module M3 \where {
   \open M1(f,g)
   \func t => f
   \func t' => g
   \func t'' => M1.h -- h is not opened and must be accessed with prefix
}
{%endarend%}

For every definition there is a corresponding module:

{%arend%}
\module M4 \where {
   \func functionModule => 34
     \where {
       \func f1 => 42
       \func f2 => 61
       \func f3 => 29
     }
   \func t => functionModule.f1
   \func t' => functionModule.f2
   \func t'' => (f1, f3)
     \where \open functionModule(f1,f3) 
	-- this \open affects everything in \where-block for t''as well as t''
}
{%endarend%}

In case there are clashes between names of definitions in different modules, these definitions can be either hidden or renamed:

{%arend%}
\module M5 \where {
    \open M2 \hiding (t') -- open all definitions except for t'
    \open M3 (t \as M3_t) -- open just t and rename it to M3_t
    \open M4 \using (t \as M4_t) -- open all definition and rename t to M4_t
    \func t'' => (M3_t, M4_t, t', t, functionModule, functionModule.f1, functionModule.f2, functionModule.f3)
    \func t''' => (t'', M2.t'', M4.t'') 
	-- t'' in the current module clashes with t'' from M2 and M4,
	-- the latter definitions should be accessed with prefix
}
{%endarend%}

The command {%ard%}\import X{%endard%} makes file X visible in the current file. Moreover, {%ard%}\import{%endard%} does
everything that {%ard%}\open{%endard%} does, all the constructs for {%ard%}\open{%endard%} are applicable to {%ard%}\import{%endard%} as well:

{%arend%}
\import Test (foobar \as foobar', foobar3)
\import TestDir.Test
-- if you want to make file visible, but do not want to make \open, you can write the fllowing:
\import TestDir.Test2()
{%endarend%}
